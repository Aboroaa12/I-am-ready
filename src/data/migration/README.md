# Data Migration Guide

This document outlines the migration process from the legacy flat data structure to the new modular data structure.

## Migration Status

### Completed Migrations
- ✅ Grade 1 - English - Family unit
- ✅ Grade 1 - English - Animals unit  
- ✅ Grade 5 - English - Welcome Back unit

### Pending Migrations
- ⏳ Grade 1 - English - Colors, Numbers, Body Parts, Food, School units
- ⏳ Grade 2 - All units
- ⏳ Grade 3 - All units
- ⏳ Grade 4 - All units
- ⏳ Grade 5 - English - Talent Show, Then and Now, Let's Explore!, etc.
- ⏳ Grade 6 - All units
- ⏳ Grade 8 - All units
- ⏳ Grade 9 - All units
- ⏳ Grade 10 - All units
- ⏳ Grade 11 - All units
- ⏳ Grade 12 - All units

## Migration Process

1. **Create unit structure**: Create the folder structure for each unit
2. **Extract content**: Separate vocabulary, grammar, and quiz content
3. **Apply templates**: Use template functions to ensure consistency
4. **Update exports**: Create proper index.ts files for exports
5. **Test compatibility**: Ensure the new structure works with existing components

## Legacy Compatibility

The system maintains backward compatibility through:
- `src/data/utils/dataAccess.ts` - Provides legacy function signatures
- `src/hooks/useModularData.ts` - Handles fallback to legacy data
- Gradual migration approach - Components continue working during migration

## Next Steps

1. Continue migrating remaining units for Grade 1
2. Migrate Grade 5 remaining units
3. Migrate other grades systematically
4. Update components to use new modular access patterns
5. Remove legacy data files once migration is complete

## Benefits After Migration

- Better organization and maintainability
- Easier content creation and management
- Type safety and consistency
- Scalable structure for future content
- Clear separation of concerns
