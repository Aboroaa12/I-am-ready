  1. Security Updates
    - Update RLS policies for teachers table to allow proper access
    - Ensure authenticated users can insert teachers
    - Add policy for anonymous users during initial setup
    - Maintain security while allowing necessary operations

  2. Changes Made
    - Drop existing restrictive policies
    - Add new policies with proper permissions
    - Allow authenticated users full CRUD access
    - Add temporary policy for initial admin setup

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can update all teachers" ON teachers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can read their own data" ON teachers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can update their own data" ON teachers;

-- Create new policies with proper permissions
CREATE POLICY "Enable all operations for authenticated users"

-- Allow anonymous users to insert teachers (for initial admin setup)
-- This should be removed in production after proper authentication is set up
